In addition to the `Block` and `MemoryPool` classes, a `Blockchain` class should also have the
following attributes:

1. `chain`: This is a list that holds the actual blockchain. Each element of the list is a
`Block` object that contains a set of transactions and a hash value.
2. `difficulty`: This is the level of difficulty for mining new blocks in the blockchain.
 It determines how hard it is to find a hash value that meets the target criteria.
3. `reward`: This is the amount of cryptocurrency that is rewarded to a miner for successfully
mining a new block.
4. `genesis_block`: This is the first block in the blockchain, which has no previous block.
It is typically hardcoded into the system and used as the starting point for the chain.

These attributes are necessary to store the blockchain, set the mining difficulty and reward, and define the genesis block.
